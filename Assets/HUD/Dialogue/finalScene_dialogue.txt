*A sinister whisper reverberates around the chamber*
Baelphegor: You know, Vera...
Gordon once did something just like what you did many years ago.
I admire your bravery.
Truly.
Unfortunately for you it's going to take a lot more to defeat me.

Do you not understand?
I hold your insignificant world in my hands!
Have fun making your way out of the rubble alive!
Haha!

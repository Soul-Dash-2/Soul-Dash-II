Cersei: Tell me about what happened here...
Phrogtender: Long ago, a hero by the name of Gordon Mattox was the protector of Ehlftaun.
He protected us from the evil forces of the cyclops Baelphegor with the power of the Soul Sword.
A relic from ancient times that is able to transfer the power of the souls it slays to its wielder.
Its origin is a mystery, some say only Gordon knew, but that information is long gone now.
One day, Baelphegor somehow managed to attack Gordon by surprise,
overwhelming him and destroying him in the process.
*Ahem* as well as a large part of the town...
Anyways, by some stroke of luck, Baelphegor retreated back into the mountains,
leaving behind minions and loyal subjects to maintain control of the land.
And as for the Soul Sword, it became inert. Its once shining blade now rusted, blunt, and chipped.
The townsfolk then decided it would be best to lay the sword at Gordon Mattox's tomb, where it remains to this day.
Baelphegor's rule still looms over us to this day.
Monsters and loyal minions of theirs roam the lands day in and out,
terrorizing those who step outside the bounds of the handful of towns that remain.
Perhaps one day someone will rid us of this curse?
Perhaps that someone is you?
